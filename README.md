The classic Black Jack game written with OOP in Python

🃏 Blackjack Game in Python
Welcome to a console-based Blackjack game implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project is a fun and interactive way to simulate the classic casino game without losing actual money.


🎮 Game Description
Blackjack (also known as 21) is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

- Number cards are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which is more favorable for the hand. 
- Players can choose to Hit (draw a card) or Stand (end their turn), and the dealer follows fixed rules to draw cards until reaching a minimum threshold (in this scenario 17).

🕹️  How to play:
1. You first select the amount of chips to bet on.
2. Both you and the dealer are dealt 2 cards. The dealer shows only one of their cards.
3. Then, you choose to Hit (to draw another card) or Stand (to end your turn). If your total goes over 21, you bust and lose the round.
4. Dealer draws cards until their total is at least 17. Dealer busts if their total exceeds 21.

🎯 Objective: Get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Beat the dealer's hand to win.
🧠 Ace Rule: Aces count as 11 unless that would cause a bust—in which case, they count as 1.

🏆 Winning:
- You win if your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's.
- It's a tie (push) if both have the same total.
- You lose if you bust or the dealer has a better hand.
